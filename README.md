#Â Tru Strap
## What is this?
This is the MSM Public version of the 'tru-strap' script.  Ref: https://github.com/jimfdavies/tru-strap

We have made this repo public so that we can download and start 'tru-strapping' without needing any credentials.  
We will pass required credentials as parameters into tru-strap in order for it to download/clone the required private repo(s).

## How do I use it?
We run this version of tru-strap via Vagrant using Docker as the VM provider on a centos 6 linux platform.

For example to start the agg (Aggregation Services):

```
git@github.com:pauldavidgilligan-msm/tru-strap.git
git checkout handsome-vagrant-docker
cd docker/centos6/agg/
vagrant up --no-parallel
```

### Documentation
More detailed documentation is maintained internally on confluence https://moneysupermarket.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=23921911

### Docker pull(s)
docker pull shipyard/rethinkdb
docker pull shipyard/shipyard
docker pull shipyard/shipyard-cli

docker pull centos

### Git Authentication
No provide keys are stored in the VM and ssh key forwarding is being used. You will need to fork
msm-provisioning, in this example, and setup you own keys on your local machine.
